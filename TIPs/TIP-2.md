# The Blockchain Bar UI - Database Explorer, Faucet, Wallet
## Vision
To help developers practice blockchain programming in a test-network by creating new features, API endpoints and database indexing.

To help developers learn what's happening behind the scenes in the blockchain network by providing several graphical components painting a better picture on:
- how the blocks are chained
- how account balances are calculated and validated
- what are the transaction attributes
- how to create a transaction
- how to sign a transaction
- how a transaction waits in a Mempool until is mined
- how the mining process works

// TODO: Add more of your ideas here.

**PS for frontend devs: We will need a new `web` directory in this repository with all the frontend code for Explorer, Faucet and Wallet.**

## Database Explorer
### Idea - Block Traversal
#### User Story
As a User I want to traverse database blocks,
so I can see all The Blockchain Bar's users activity and what happened when.

#### Backend Proposal [DONE âœ“]
Add a new API endpoint `/block/$height` to `./node/http_routes.go` to retrieve block by number.

Add a new API endpoint `/block/$hash` to `./node/http_routes.go`  to retrieve block by hash.

Both endpoints will return a Block as JSON:
```
type Block struct {
	Header BlockHeader `json:"header"`
	TXs    []SignedTx  `json:"payload"`
}

type BlockHeader struct {
	Parent Hash           `json:"parent"`
	Number uint64         `json:"number"`
	Nonce  uint32         `json:"nonce"`
	Time   uint64         `json:"time"`
	Miner  common.Address `json:"miner"`
}

type BlockFS struct {
	Key   Hash  `json:"hash"`
	Value Block `json:"block"`
}
```

The easiest way to achieve this ATM will be by modifying the `func GetBlocksAfter(blockHash Hash, dataDir string) ([]Block, error) {` and adding a new argument `limit uint` to the function. As well as creating another getter to the `database` package like `func GetBlocksByNumberAfter(blockHash Hash, limit uint, dataDir string) ([]Block, error) {` and abstracting the common code shared between these two functions (the already implement blocks retrieval from disk) to a third function.

#### Frontend Proposal [PENDING]
// TODO: Add here some UI ideas how this could be displayed in the UI.

### Idea - Visualize P2P with Animations
#### User Story
As a User I want to see how transactions are broadcasted over p2p,
so I have a better idea what's happening after a transaction is broadcasted.

## Currently Available API endpoints:
The below list is very limited and would need a lot of new API endpoints to support all above UI features. Great opportunity to practice Go programming. 

### Query the latest balances of all accounts
https://node.tbb.web3.coach/balances/list

```json
{
  "block_hash": "00000050159ee00da041cb8bd1a1974ea80da53f8489ade6c4886dcf48205ca9",

### Unlock wallet to sign a transaction and broadcast it
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/tx/add' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"from": "0x22ba1f...",
	"from_pwd": "",
	"to": "0x6fdc0d...",
	"value": 100,
	"gas": 21,
